"""Lyrical coherence judge — asks an LLM to judge sung lyrics.

Sends intended lyrics + Whisper transcription to the configured judge
provider and asks: does the sung result make sense as a song? Creative
deviations from intended lyrics are fine as long as the output is coherent.

Runs in the worker parent, on the scores the scorer child returned: it is
the one scorer that calls an external service, and the child that loads
third-party model weights holds no credential (see docs/security.md).
