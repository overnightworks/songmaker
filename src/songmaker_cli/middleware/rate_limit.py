"""Global per-IP rate limiter -- defense against multi-account abuse.

Requests are split into budget classes so that one traffic pattern cannot
starve another sharing the same IP (issue #257): a player streaming an MP3
in range chunks, or an SSE connection reconnecting after a network hiccup,
used to compete for the same 120-requests/minute budget as everything else
and could lock a working user out of their own session. `_classify_path` is
the single place that maps a path to a class; every request gets exactly one
class, and an unrecognized path falls into the API class (fail closed, not
fail open).

# Every Range-served audio endpoint outside `/audio/*`, one regex per
# literal route in sharing_api.py / queue_stream_api.py -- each requires
# the `audio` segment at the exact position that route defines, so a slug
# that literally reads "audio" cannot slide a real metadata route
# (`/shared/{slug}`, `/shared/{slug}/cover`, the `/stream` manifest POSTs)
# into the Media class by shape alone (issue #257 review finding:
# `/shared/song/audio`, `/shared/audio/cover`, etc. must stay API).
# `[^/]+` pins the slug/id to exactly one segment; the trailing `/.+` on
# the filename routes requires an actual filename segment, so a bare
# `.../audio` with nothing after it (what a same-shaped metadata slug
# produces) does not match. The bare-slug pattern additionally excludes
# the `song/`, `gen/`, `playlist/`, and `queue-streams/` prefixes via a
# negative lookahead -- without it, `/shared/playlist/audio/stream`
# ([^/]+="playlist", filename="stream") would misclassify the
# `/shared/playlist/{slug}/stream` manifest POST (slug="audio") as Media;
# the router resolves that path to the metadata handler, not the bare-slug
# audio route, and the four sibling routes already have their own patterns
# below, so excluding their prefixes here costs the bare-slug pattern
# nothing. All are `FileResponse`, which serves Range requests -- the same
# seek/scrub pattern as `/audio/*`, just for a stranger listening to a
# public share (or, for the queue-streams routes, an authenticated preview)
# instead of the owner's own player. A public share is the operator's
# public face: a listener range-requesting a shared album must not be
# locked out by the same API budget that locked out the operator's own
