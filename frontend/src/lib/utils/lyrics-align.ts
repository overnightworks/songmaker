// Deterministic lyric↔Whisper-cue alignment (issue #45, contract confirmed
// on #52, word timestamps added on #142). Pure and offline-testable: no
// player state, no DOM coupling. The Now Playing lyrics column is the sole
// consumer. scripts/lyric_alignment_golden.py holds the reference
// implementation both paths are pinned against.
//
// Two paths, chosen by what the take was scored with:
//
// words — a take scored with word timestamps carries a word stream. Lyric
// lines are walked in order and each one takes the best-matching run of
// still-unconsumed words, so the interval is the line's own first…last sung
// word. The cursor never moves backwards.
//
// cue windows (fallback) — a take scored before word timestamps carries only
// segment cues, and a segment follows breathing pauses rather than line
// breaks, so one cue routinely covers up to three lyric lines. Cues are
// walked in playback order and each takes the best-matching run of up to
// three still-unconsumed lines, and every line of that run carries the whole
// cue span. Nothing in such a take says where inside the cue one line ends
// and the next begins, so those lines light together rather than on invented
// per-line timing (#45); only a re-score buys real per-line intervals.
//
// Both paths share the same accept rule: the best candidate must clear
// MIN_RATIO, and it must beat every rival by AMBIGUITY_MARGIN. A rival is a
// candidate that overlaps neither the winner nor any word-for-word repeat of
// the winner's text. Overlapping candidates are one rendition seen through a
// shifted window, and a repeat of the same words is not independent evidence
// of where the line was sung (#45) — nor is a shifted window around such a
// repeat, which is why a chorus line is never blocked by its own repeats.
// Anything short of that leaves the line dark: a missed highlight is a gap,
// a wrong one is a lie.

// a line was sung — it only decides, in playback order, which rendition each
// line takes. The tolerance applies only where the lyrics really do ask for
// those words more than once; for a line the lyrics carry once, two readings
