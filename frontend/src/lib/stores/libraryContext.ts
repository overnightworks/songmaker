// library address was `/` or `/?song=…` — always the same route. Since an open
// album addresses `/album/<slug>` (issue #269), an open song addresses one
// segment deeper, `/album/<slug>/<song>` (issue #275), and a selected take one
// segment deeper still, `/album/<slug>/<song>/take/<n>` (issue #281), a write
// can change which of the four route files (`/`, `/album/[slug]`,
// `/album/[slug]/[song]`, `/album/[slug]/[song]/take/[n]`) the address names,
// and a raw one would leave the router mounting the file it last saw while the
// address names another: the next real navigation or Back/Forward that
// disagrees tears the workspace down mid-session, with an unsaved draft still
// in it. `libraryRouteShape` names which of the four a pathname is, and a
// write that changes it goes through `goto`, which uses the same History API
// but keeps the router in step, while the frequent same-shape churn (filter,
// sort, scroll, search cursor, switching to another song within the same open
// album since #275, and switching to another take of the same open song since
// #281) keeps the cheap synchronous write.
//
// `goto` puts its own `state` option in `page.state`, not in `history.state`,
// which is where every reader of the library's restore state looks — so the
// state is written onto the entry after the navigation lands, and `goto`'s
// state option is deliberately unused.
//
// Writes are serialized because a crossing one is asynchronous: a caller that
// writes twice in a row (open a song, then pin its take) must not have its
// second write overtake the first, and must see the entry the first one is
// going to install rather than the stale one it would still read from
// `history.state` — which is what `currentLibraryHistoryState` answers.
//
// The same-shape raw write is a permanent design choice, not scaffolding a
// later cleanup should finish by routing everything through `goto`: issue
// #276 measured what a `goto` costs per write (a real SvelteKit navigation,
// its own route resolution and reactive re-run) against how often the
// same-shape case actually fires — filter/sort/search-cursor/scroll on
// nearly every interaction with the wall, a song-to-song or take-to-take
// move on every list click and Previous/Next — and going through the router
// for all of it would turn the library's most frequent writes into its most
// expensive ones for a distinction (which route *file* is mounted) that
// same-shape churn never changes. `libraryRouteShape` is what makes "does
// this write cross" a real question instead of "is this a write" — treating
// every write as a crossing would be simpler code, but wrong on the
// frequency this store actually sees; see the `LibraryRouteShape` note above
// for what a wrongly-collapsed shape does when a crossing goes undetected
// instead. Issue #265's S7 (which removed `ensureLibraryWorkspaceRoute`,
// #264's now-redundant separate guard, once this shape-based check alone was
// proven to cover everything it did) confirmed the choice rather than

// cancel out from under it. A cold tab starts both at once (this resolution
// and the stream's own bootstrap, which calls cancelAlbumSongLoads as part
// of beginning its epoch) and loadSongsForAlbum silently drops a cancelled
// fetch's results instead of failing it, which read as an honest
// "unknown-song" verdict for a song that plainly exists -- discovered the
// hard way against a real stack (#275), not caught by jsdom, which has no
// live stream to race. Once found, the song is upserted into songList the
// same way a song opened directly from a search hit or a share link already
// is, so applyLibraryHistory's own loadSongsForAlbum call for the rest of the
// album does not have to carry it too.
