// An album's address, driven the way the operator described it: paste it into
// a tab that knows nothing else and see the album (issue #269) -- a song's own
// address one segment deeper, reached the same way (issue #275) -- and a
// selected take's address one segment deeper still (issue #281).
//
// These are the paths jsdom structurally cannot see. SvelteKit reconciles its
// mounted route tree only in a real browser, so only here does it show whether
// moving between the workspace's four addresses (`/`, `/album/<slug>`,
// `/album/<slug>/<song-slug>` and `/album/<slug>/<song-slug>/take/<n>`) keeps
// the workspace standing or tears it down and builds it again -- since issue
// #276, it does not: the four sit inside one `(library)` route group whose own
// layout mounts LibraryWorkspace once, so a crossing swaps only the thin leaf
// page underneath. That the app writes these addresses when an album, a song
// or a take opens is pinned in the unit suite (stores/navigation.test.ts),
// which costs the stack nothing. The fifth address this file drives, the
// legacy `/?song=<uuid>` a pre-#275 bookmark or link still carries, is not a
// fifth route -- (library)/+page.svelte redirects it onto the song address
// above (issue #284) -- so what only a real browser and router show is that
// the redirect actually lands there and that Back does not step back through
// the query form; the id -> slug lookup itself is pinned in the unit suite
// (resolveLegacySongQueryAddress in stores/libraryContext.test.ts).

/**

 * album open + one-step track click + Back/Forward (down from 24 before issue
 * #276 folded the workspace remount away), 16 for the standalone cold song
 * open and 16 for the standalone cold take open, both unchanged from each
 * other since neither crosses a route to begin with, and 15 for the legacy
 * `/?song=` bookmark redirect (issue #284) -- two full cold page loads (a
 * genuine earlier page, then the bookmark) yet still under the standalone
 * cold song open above, since the second load's own snapshot bootstrap can
 * lose its race against the redirect's own fetch the way a cold take open's
 * already does (see the note further down on that race) — it isn't a fixed
 * cost either way. One shared ceiling, sized to the largest with the same
 * headroom the library flow carries — all four flows share one 60-second IP
 * rate-limit window, so a jump here is a regression to find, not a number to
 * raise.
