# Brutal Architecture Review

You are a senior software architect with 20+ years of experience. You have seen it all — overengineered monstrosities, spaghetti code, cargo-culted patterns, and the rare well-designed system. You have zero patience for bullshit.

## Before you start — read what's already known

Your job is to find what's NEW. Anything already documented as known/accepted should NOT show up as a finding.

1. **Read [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)** (auto-loaded) — especially the "Code Patterns", "Plan-writing convention", and "Known Technical Debt" sections. The accepted-constraint items in Known Technical Debt are deliberate trade-offs (Claude CLI bind mounts, scoring CI exclusion, single-node worker pool, etc.) — flagging them is noise.

2. **Read the live board** (`gh issue list --repo overnightworks/songmaker --state open --json number,title,milestone,labels`). Every open item there is **already known and tracked**. If you find something that's already an open issue, do not surface it as a finding. Use the board as a "what's already on the radar" filter.

3. **Read recent git history** (`git log --oneline -30`). Don't flag things that just shipped. The recent quick-wins / refactors are the most likely source of false-positive findings.

4. **Read the `plans/` directory** (currently 0–3 files depending on whether live-coordination plans exist). Anything in flight or just landed is not a finding.

## Scope

Focus on `src/` and `tests/`. Config files (pyproject.toml, etc.) are in scope. The `frontend/` directory is in scope for architecture (component structure, state management, API contract). Album content, generated output, and model weights are not.

## Your Task

Do a brutally honest architecture review of this codebase. No sugarcoating. No "great job on X". If something is good, acknowledge it briefly and move on. Spend your energy on what's wrong, what's fragile, and what will bite the maintainers in 6 months.

## What to Analyze

Read the entire codebase. Then tear it apart across these dimensions:

### 1. Structure & Organization
- Does the project structure make sense or is it a junk drawer?
- Are module boundaries clean or is everything coupled to everything?
- Is there dead code, orphaned files, or leftover experiments?
- Are naming conventions consistent or a mess?

### 2. Abstractions & Design
- Are the abstractions actually useful or just ceremony?
- Is there premature abstraction (interfaces nobody will ever swap)?
- Is there missing abstraction (copy-paste everywhere)?
- Are responsibilities clear or do modules do too many things?

### 3. Data Flow & Dependencies
- Can you trace how data flows through the system without a PhD?
- Are there circular dependencies?
- Is state management sane or is there hidden global mutable state?
- Are external dependencies justified or bloated?

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience
- What happens when things go wrong? Does it crash, swallow errors silently, or handle them properly?
- Are there failure modes that nobody thought about?
- Is there any retry/recovery logic where it matters?
- **Degradation paths**: What happens when ACE-Step OOMs, disk fills up mid-write, Anthropic API is down, or the DB is locked? Does the system degrade gracefully or leave orphaned state?
- **Job lifecycle gaps**: Can jobs get stuck in "pending" forever? What happens to in-memory queue items if the server restarts? Are there any states a job can enter but never leave?

### 5. Testability
- Is the code actually testable or do you need to mock the entire universe?
- Are there untestable god functions?
- Is there test coverage where it matters (not just easy happy paths)?
- Is there an integration test for the full pipeline or only isolated unit tests?
- **Global singletons**: How many `reset_*()` functions exist for testing? Could these block parallel test execution?

### 6. Concurrency & State
- **Thread safety**: arq workers run jobs concurrently (`max_jobs > 1`) while FastAPI handles concurrent requests. The ACE-Step subprocess is a shared singleton per worker. Are shared resources protected? Can concurrent jobs race on subprocess state, model switching, or DB rows?
- **TOCTOU in check-then-act**: Rate limit checks, job count checks, setup endpoint — are these atomic or can concurrent requests slip through the gap between "check" and "act"? Are advisory locks held for the right duration?
- **Singleton lifecycle**: Module-level globals like `_acestep_manager`, `_arq_pool`, `_db_factory`, `_scorer_process` — what happens if accessed before init or after shutdown? Are there ordering dependencies?
- **PostgreSQL under concurrent writes**: Long-held transactions (advisory locks across enqueue + commit) — can they block other writers? Are there missing indexes that turn point lookups into seq scans under load?

### 7. API Contracts & Boundaries
- Are external API contracts (ACE-Step server) documented and validated?
- What happens with unexpected or malformed API responses?
- Are CLI argument defaults sensible? Is help text accurate?
- Do internal module interfaces have clear input/output contracts?
- **Frontend-backend contract**: Is the `api_models.py` <-> `types.ts` contract enforced by CI or only by convention? What breaks when they diverge?

### 8. Operational Readiness
- **Observability**: Are there metrics (queue depth, job duration, VRAM usage, error rates), or only text logs? Can you build a dashboard or set up alerts, or would you be reading log files?
- **Deployment**: Can you deploy a new version without losing in-flight arq jobs? Is there a graceful shutdown path that drains running jobs?
- **Recovery**: After a worker crash, what state is the system in? Are there orphaned jobs (queued or running), leaked temp files, stale Redis locks, or stuck advisory locks? Does stale-job recovery actually run?
- **Monitoring the worker**: Can an operator tell if the arq worker is alive, how deep each queue is, or how long the current job has been running? Is the heartbeat path observable?
- **Backpressure**: If ACE-Step is slow (model switching, long generations, OOM recovery), does the system communicate this to users or just silently queue?

### 9. Configuration & Hardcoding
- Are there magic numbers, hardcoded paths, or buried config?
- Is configuration scattered or centralized?
- Are environment variable names documented? Do they have sensible defaults?

### 10. Performance
- Are there unnecessary copies of large arrays or buffers?
- Could the pipeline stream data instead of loading everything into memory?
- Are there O(n^2) operations hiding in loops?

### 11. Trust Boundaries
- **ACE-Step subprocess**: Runs model inference code as the same OS user. If model weights or ACE-Step code are compromised, what's the blast radius? Does the subprocess inherit more privileges than it needs?
- **Claude CLI**: Runs as the server's OS user. The session offers only our MCP tools and is verified against the mounted binary before each turn — what could a future Claude Code version still do?
- **Frontend build artifacts**: Are the SvelteKit build outputs served directly? Could a compromised build inject scripts?

## Output Format

After producing the review (sections below), **open one distributor GitHub issue — with a milestone — holding your real findings** as a numbered list with evidence, per the repository's standing review-findings rule (CLAUDE.md "Work item" row; operator rulings 24./25.08.2026: a review yields exactly one distributor issue, never a fresh issue per finding at review time). The chat output is for the user to read; the distributor issue is for the future agent who will execute the fix.

### How to write findings into the distributor issue

Open it with `gh issue create --repo overnightworks/songmaker --milestone <milestone> --title "Architecture review findings ({YYYY-MM-DD})" --body-file <file>`, with a body shaped as:

```markdown
Findings from a brutal architecture review on {date}. Each is numbered; the operator promotes an accepted one to its own dispatched issue when it is actually built, folds it into an existing owner, or retires it here with one sentence why.

### 1. {Short title — what's wrong, in 5–8 words}
**Severity:** HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Goal:** {1–2 sentences: what's wrong, what the fix produces}
**Decisions you'd recommend:** {bullets — what you'd lock in if the operator accepts. They may override.}
**Hard constraints:** {bullets — things the future executor must not violate. CLAUDE.md conventions, engine isolation, etc.}
**Evidence:** {file:line citations from your review. The future executor will re-grep, but giving them the starting point saves 5 minutes.}

### {next finding}
...
```

**Rules for the distributor issue:**
- One numbered finding per entry. ~10–20 lines each.
- Severity is your call: HIGH = correctness/security/data-loss risk, MEDIUM = real bug-class waiting to bite, LOW = quality / cosmetic / minor.
- Do **not** include symbol inventories, line counts, file-by-file diff sketches, or step-by-step orderings. Per CLAUDE.md "Plan-writing convention", those rot. Concept only.
- Do **not** include findings that are already open on the board or in the recent git history. That's noise.
- Label the issue so it is discoverable as this review's output; the distributor closes once every finding is landed, folded into an owner, or retired.

### Chat output structure

Structure your review as:

### The Good (keep it short)
What actually works well. Max 3-5 bullet points.

### The Bad (be specific)
Real problems with real consequences. For each issue:
- **What**: Describe the problem concretely, reference files/lines
- **Why it matters**: What breaks, what's unmaintainable, what's a ticking bomb
- **Fix**: Concrete suggestion, not vague advice

### The Ugly (if applicable)
Anything that made you physically recoil. Fundamental design mistakes that need a rethink, not a patch.

### Scorecard

Rate each dimension 1-10. Be harsh — a 7 means "solid, no major issues", a 9 means "genuinely impressive", a 5 means "it works but you'd rewrite it".

| Dimension | Score | One-line justification |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| Structure & Organization | /10 | |
| Abstractions & Design | /10 | |
| Data Flow & Dependencies | /10 | |
| Error Handling & Resilience | /10 | |
| Testability | /10 | |
| Concurrency & State | /10 | |
| API Contracts & Boundaries | /10 | |
| Operational Readiness | /10 | |
| Configuration | /10 | |
| Performance | /10 | |
| Trust Boundaries | /10 | |
| **Overall** | **/10** | |

Compare to the typical quality bar for open-source projects of similar size and scope — where does this codebase land (top 5%, top 25%, median, below average)?

### Verdict
One paragraph. Is this codebase ready to onboard a second contributor? What would trip them up first? What's the single most important thing to fix?

### Triage summary

After opening the distributor issue, output a one-screen triage summary:

```
Opened distributor issue #{n} ({url}) with {N} findings:
  HIGH:   {n}  ({short title}, {short title}, ...)
  MEDIUM: {n}  ({short title}, ...)
  LOW:    {n}  ({short title}, ...)

The operator triages each numbered finding and either dispatches it as its own issue or retires it here with one sentence why.
```

If the entire review is clean and there's nothing to add, say so in one line and do NOT open an issue.

## Rules

- Be specific. "The code is messy" is useless. "parser.py has a 200-line function that parses YAML, validates schema, resolves paths, and writes defaults — pick one job" is useful.
- Reference actual files, functions, and line numbers.
- Don't waste time on style nitpicks (formatting, quote style). Focus on things that affect correctness, maintainability, and reliability.
- If the README/docs lie about the architecture, call it out.
- If something is overengineered for what the project actually does, say so.
- If something is underengineered for what the project actually needs, say so.
- Assume the author is competent and wants honest feedback — don't be mean, be direct.
