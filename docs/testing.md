# Testing Guide

## Running Tests

Agents and subagents run **only the tests that prove the change** and omit
`-n auto`; GitHub CI explicitly sets `-n auto` for parallel test runs, while
the full suite remains its responsibility (atelier-2 rule: local = targeted,
land gate = CI).

The auto-deploy subprocess tests fake Docker and GitHub: they prove that a
missing base image or a `docker/base/**` change rebuilds bases before Compose,
that an unchanged candidate does not, and that the post-deploy image prune
excludes the base-image label.

```bash
# Backend — targeted (local / agents)
pytest tests/test_api.py -q --tb=short
pytest tests/test_queue_streams.py tests/test_playlists.py -q

# Frontend — targeted (local / agents)
cd frontend && pnpm exec vitest run src/lib/stores/player.test.ts
cd frontend && pnpm exec vitest run src/lib/services/offline.test.ts

# Full suite — CI only, or when the operator asks
pytest tests/ -n auto -q --cov=songmaker_cli --cov=audio_engine --cov=acestep_engine --cov=acestep_worker --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=93 --cov-config=.coveragerc-ci
cd frontend && pnpm check && pnpm lint && pnpm test:coverage && pnpm build
```

## Static analysis (SonarCloud)

GitHub CI runs SonarCloud analysis from the repository-root [`sonar-project.properties`](../sonar-project.properties). The `backend` and `frontend` jobs produce pytest XML and Vitest lcov coverage reports; the advisory `sonar` job downloads both reports and scans the same commit. The [SonarCloud project page](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=overnightworks_songmaker) shows the resulting analysis and coverage.

Before the first CI scan, an operator must disable **Automatic Analysis** in the SonarCloud project. SonarCloud rejects CI-based analysis while that setting remains enabled; until then the scan is advisory and may fail without blocking CI.

The scope covers `src` and `frontend/src`. Backend `tests`, frontend unit tests, and frontend E2E tests are test scope. It excludes the vendored ACE-Step fork (`vendor/**`, maintained in its own repository), design mockups (`docs/design/**`), generated test artifacts (`frontend/e2e/test-results/**` and `frontend/playwright-report/**`), planning material (`plans/**`), dependencies (`**/node_modules/**`), SvelteKit output (`**/.svelte-kit/**`), and frontend build output (`frontend/build/**`). These are not product code and would distort the analysis.

Coverage exclusions are intentionally narrower and identical in `.coveragerc-ci` and `sonar-project.properties`: `src/songmaker_cli/main.py` (CLI entry point and local recovery commands); `src/songmaker_cli/scoring/audiobox_aesthetics.py` and `src/songmaker_cli/scoring/emotional_dynamics.py` (heavy model runtime absent from CI); `src/songmaker_cli/scoring/lyrical_coherence.py` (external-provider judge); `src/songmaker_cli/scoring/text_accuracy.py` (Whisper model absent from CI); `src/songmaker_cli/db/migrations/versions/**` (historical Alembic/PostgreSQL deployment artifacts); and `frontend/src/service-worker.ts` (browser/build runtime proven outside Vitest coverage). Testable scorers and the MCP entry point remain measured.

The profile deliberately ignores two repository-wide smells. `python:S9100` is ignored for `tests/**` because these pytest fixtures use `yield` as setup syntax without teardown; changing them to `return` would only optimize a test-style diagnostic and add no product value. `docker:S7031` is ignored for `**/*Dockerfile*` because separate `RUN` instructions mark intentional install, cache, permission, and model-warmup boundaries; the pattern covers both `Dockerfile` and the repository's `*.Dockerfile` names. These exceptions are limited to their named paths and rules; other Sonar findings remain visible.

### Parallel Execution

CI runs tests in parallel via `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto` uses all CPU cores). All tests are isolated:
- Each test gets its own `tmp_path` and SQLite database
- `mock_arq_pool` fixture (conftest.py) isolates the arq connection pool
- `_reset_settings_cache` and `_reset_worker_singletons` autouse fixtures clear `Settings`/`WorkerBase` per-test state
- Settings/worker singletons are reset by fixtures; scorer model caches live in subprocesses
- Heavy scorer tests are excluded from CI coverage because the CI image doesn't ship the Whisper/provider model runtimes; BPM, silence, and spectral scorers remain measured (see `.coveragerc-ci`)

## Coverage Targets

- **CI backend**: 93% overall across `songmaker_cli` + `audio_engine` + `acestep_engine` + `acestep_worker` (the four heavy scoring modules are excluded; lightweight scoring modules remain measured, see `.coveragerc-ci`). CI also installs the `mcp` extra so `tests/test_mcp_server.py` collects.
- **Local**: aim for 100% on non-scoring core modules (exclude `main.py` CLI entrypoint)
- **CI frontend**: `pnpm test:coverage` (90% statement and 93% line floors on `src/lib/**/*.ts`, generated `types.ts` excluded) plus `pnpm build`. 100% on `lib/` remains a local aspiration, not a CI gate.
- **CI PostgreSQL contract**: `tests/test_postgresql.py` runs serially (`-n 0`) against PostgreSQL 16. It is the mandatory proof for migrations, concurrent per-user event-sequence allocation, transactional rollback, and retention gaps; SQLite tests do not stand in for these guarantees.
- **Resource-event transport**: `tests/test_resource_event_api.py` proves the full auth/session boundary, fresh/replay/gap/ahead protocol, paged retention races, exact user isolation, BIGINT-safe wire values, final production headers, 60-second termination (including a blocked outer ASGI send), Redis leases, and fail-closed limits. Protocol-generator tests remain deterministic and route tests use the real app/middleware stack.

GitHub workflows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `e2e.yml`, `security.yml`,
`requirements.yml`, and `requirement-witnesses.yml`) run on push/PR to `main`.
Security and live requirement-witness verification also run weekly. The
requirement workflows are separate visible checks, not enforced merge gates
while issue #31 remains open. The live checks are:

| Job | What |
|---|---|
| Backend | `ruff check src/ tests/` · `scripts/check_no_silent_fallbacks.py src/` · `scripts/generate_types.py --check` · pytest + 93% coverage |
| PostgreSQL contract | Serial PostgreSQL 16 tests for dialect-specific migrations, concurrency, rollback, and event retention gaps |
| Frontend | `pnpm check` · `pnpm lint` · `pnpm test:coverage` · `pnpm build` |
| E2E | Boots the CI stack (`docker-compose.ci.yml`), curl-smokes it, then drives the desktop library flow in Chromium against it |
| Security | bandit (`pyproject.toml`: skip B101/B110/B310/B404/B603, exclude tests; B104/B105/B608 nosec only on known false positives) · pip-audit · `pnpm audit --prod` (the frontend audit retries registry outages and annotates an inconclusive result) |
| Requirements | strict offline requirement/acceptance schema · exact bytes and linear history · exact PR/push base · derived PRODUCT view |
| Requirement witnesses | fixed GitHub repo/issue/comment re-fetch · exact identity, URL, author, timestamp, and approval-body match |
| Acceptance evidence | #42-A1 runs the marked Pick-replacement API test and retains its commit-bound JSON report for 30 days |

### No-silent-fallbacks check

`scripts/check_no_silent_fallbacks.py src/` has no per-violation allowlist. A
reported hit is a defect to fix, and a legitimate exception is expressed in
the code instead, as a narrow, documented role exemption tied to a specific
file's job:

- **Env reads** belong to the settings module of the package that needs them.
  All read forms count, including the ones carrying a fallback:
  `os.environ.get` / `.pop` / `.setdefault`, `os.getenv`, and `os.environ[K]`.
  Writes, `del`, augmented assignment, and `os.environ.copy()` are process
  state, not configuration, and are not reported. Three roles are out of
  scope, matched by path rather than by file name (so `api_models/settings.py`
  is still judged): `src/<package>/settings.py`, the Alembic migration
  `db/migrations/env.py` (it runs before Settings exists), and
  `src/songmaker_cli/env_override.py`, which owns `temporary_env_override()`
  — the single save-and-restore idiom for a library that reads a variable
  like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` on its own.
- **A nullable timestamp** that the response computes is declared as
  `ComputedTimestamp` (`api_models/fields.py`). Plain `datetime | None` on a
  timestamp field still fails, because that is how a NOT NULL column gets
  misdescribed.
- **`cowriter/tools.py`** is exempt from the `dict[str, Any]`-in-signature
  rule: `execute_cowriter_tool` dispatches raw MCP tool-call JSON across the
  heterogeneous handlers whose only shared shape is each tool's own JSON
  Schema (`CowriterTool.parameters`). Collapsing that into named per-tool
  argument models is a multi-file rework, tracked as a follow-up (#332,
  finding F15), not something this checker fixes by itself.

`tests/test_check_no_silent_fallbacks.py` runs the checker over the real
`src/` tree, over a table of read and write statements that pins that
boundary, and over seeded files at every path that used to be exempt.

### API type contract

`scripts/generate_types.py --check` derives the browser contract from the
registered `api`, `health_api`, and `sharing_api` routers without starting the
application lifecycle. It follows every route's `response_model` and body
parameter through nested Pydantic annotations, then supplements that set with
exported `api_models` and checks that each discovered model has a TypeScript
interface in `frontend/src/lib/api/types.ts`. The output always states `Checked
N API models`. The only route role excluded is
`/api/internal/`: worker registration is a
backend-to-backend protocol rather than a browser surface.

Run `python scripts/generate_types.py` after changing a routed model, then
`python scripts/generate_types.py --check`. `tests/test_generate_types.py`
plants routed response, body, and nested models to prove a stale type file
fails with the missing model name and a regenerated file passes.

### Alert rules (promtool)

`monitoring/rules/alert.rules.yml` is Prometheus' own schema, so Prometheus' own
tool checks and unit-tests it rather than pytest.
`monitoring/alert.rules.test.yml` feeds the real rule file synthetic series
and asserts which alerts fire — in particular that a job failure is caught
both when Prometheus watched the metric across it and when its very first
sample of the series already carries it (issue #333). CI runs this as the
`alert-rules` job; locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/monitoring:/monitoring:ro" -w /monitoring \
  --entrypoint promtool prom/prometheus:latest test rules alert.rules.test.yml
```

### Acceptance evidence pilot

#42-A1 is one Pytest integration proof for `ACC-CURATION-02` →
`REQ-CURATION-02`. It exercises the FastAPI router and SQLite persistence through
the test client with its test-auth override. It does not prove session/login,
PostgreSQL, a separate server, browser, UI, accessibility, or E2E behavior.
`scripts/acceptance_evidence.py` accepts only one literal direct marker per
top-level test, rejects unknown or orphaned critical integration claims, runs the
claimed tests serially, and writes a point-in-time report containing the checked
out commit, command, exit status, and result. The CI job uploads that report even
when the test fails; its visible result is not a required merge gate until branch
protection is configured.

The witness test suite uses injected fake GitHub clients and transports; local
tests never need a token or make network calls. It covers strict witness parsing,
the empty no-network path, resource and time limits including the outer watchdog,
fixed routes, fork-PR token isolation, pathological JSON, and mismatches at each
link of the repository→issue→comment identity
chain. A green live check proves only what GitHub returned during that run; the
edited/deleted event hooks and weekly schedule reduce, but cannot eliminate, the
time between a later invalidation and detection.

The local binder is covered separately by
`tests/test_requirement_binder.py` and `tests/test_bind_requirement_revision.py`.
Those tests use temporary Git repositories and fake GitHub clients. They cover
Genesis/successor lineage, canonical witness bytes, exact Git/index states,
token isolation from Git, live-capture TOCTOU, process locking and wall timeout,
no-clobber collisions, permission preservation, full planned-contract checks,
same-byte foreign ownership, bounded ignored-directory scans, the final expected
delta, and rollback/manual-recovery behavior at every write boundary. They never
create a real approval or make a network request.

## End-to-end flows

`frontend/e2e/` drives the real stack — Postgres, Redis, migrations and the web
container from `docker-compose.ci.yml` — through the click paths an operator
walks by hand. Unit tests keep missing those: every operator bug from
2026-08-23 (dead picker, ▶ after an album switch, shuffle, 429 storm) passed
them.

Two Chromium projects walk the same flow: `desktop` at 1440×900 and `mobile` at
390×844 with touch input. The steps the two shells share are written once; the
mobile project adds what the compact shell does differently — the rail as a
drawer, the editor opening on Write, Now Playing's judging panel as a sheet,
the one 64px transport row with a thumb-sized play control — plus a 320-wide
check that the album header still reads as a title over its breadcrumb.

What a flow proves that a unit test cannot: the album pick really plays (the
transport offers Pause, not Retry), Now Playing opens on the judged take, a
take reaches a playlist and can be reordered and pruned there, a playlist row
plays and judges its take the same way an editor take row does — docked beside
the playlist on desktop, as a sheet on mobile — shuffle toggles, and a share
link serves the album to a logged-out visitor. A second `library.spec.ts` test
proves the rail itself the same way (issue #326): a collapsed row's songs are
provably invisible and an expanded row's provably not — `grid-template-rows:
0fr` + `overflow: hidden` collapses to zero height only in a real layout
engine, which jsdom never runs — the rail's one-open-album rule holds as that
same real visibility, and Settings stays in view after the rail's own list is
scrolled. Any 429 or 5xx response, failed request, browser console error or
uncaught page exception fails the flow, and each flow holds a named `/api`
request budget per shell.

- **Projects run serially** (`fullyParallel: false`, one worker). Both shells
  share one stack behind one IP rate-limit window, so their cost is additive
  and measurable instead of a burst. Each flow's measured count and budget are
  a code comment on its constant (`LIBRARY_FLOW_API_REQUEST_BUDGET`,
  `RAIL_FLOW_API_REQUEST_BUDGET` in `frontend/e2e/helpers.ts`) — that is the
  one place the number is written down, so it cannot drift out of sync with
  this doc the way it did before issue #326.
- **One login per run.** Global setup authenticates once, seeds an album, songs,
  takes, a pick and a share link through the public API, and hands its session
  to every attempt as storage state. Mutable fixtures (the playlist) are seeded
  per attempt so a retry starts clean.
- **Selectors are roles and accessible names** from `frontend/src/lib/constants.ts`.
  No `data-testid`. A row that cannot be found by its accessible name is an
  accessibility defect, not a selector problem.
- **Locally, never point them at port 8080** — that is the operator's stack.
  Boot the CI stack on its own port and project (`WEB_PORT=18080`), run
  `E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:18080 pnpm test:e2e`, then `down -v`.
- Re-running against a warm stack trips the app's IP rate limit (120 requests
  per window) and the flow reports 429s. That is the guard working, not
  flakiness — reset the stack or wait out the window.
- The CI stack allows 200 resource-event stream opens per user. In the
  2026-09-05 CI run, 30 opens succeeded and the 31st returned 429.

`frontend/e2e/README.md` has the exact commands, the audio fixture, and the
budget rule.

### Voices E2E worker

The Voices browser flow adds `docker-compose.e2e-voices.yml` to the normal CI
stack. It starts the test-only worker at
`tests/e2e_fixtures/fake_training_worker.py`; the Library E2E continues to use
only `docker-compose.ci.yml`.

Run it under the probe lock with the isolated project and port:

```bash
flock /tmp/songmaker-probe.lock env \
  COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=songmaker-i689-probe \
  WEB_PORT=18080 \
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=e2e-ci-postgres-password \
  SESSION_SECRET=e2e-ci-session-secret-do-not-reuse-anywhere-else \
  SONGMAKER_INTERNAL_TOKEN=e2e-ci-internal-token \
  ADMIN_USERNAME=e2e-ci-admin \
  ADMIN_PASSWORD='E2eCiSmoke#2026!' \
  PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:18080 \
  E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:18080 \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ci.yml \
  -f docker-compose.e2e-voices.yml up -d --build --wait \
  postgres redis migrate songmaker-web songmaker-music-worker \
  songmaker-voices-e2e-worker
```

Run its browser proof with the same stack marker, so the normal Library E2E
run never tries to exercise the Voices-only worker:

```bash
cd frontend
E2E_VOICES_STACK=1 E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:18080 pnpm exec playwright test e2e/voices.spec.ts
```

The fake worker uses the same internal worker registration, Redis heartbeat,
GPU-hold, task-SSE, and adapter-result contracts as the ACE-Step worker. It
only replaces model training and generation output; ARQ, job, and database
handling remain in the application. The two S5 occupancy jobs target one
dedicated song/version whose existing prompt exactly equals
`FAKE_GENERATION_OCCUPANCY_PROMPT`; no generation request carries a prompt.
All other fake generations produce a deterministic 1-second mono WAV from the
exact tuple `(prompt, seed, adapter path)`. The browser proof trains its voices
through the normal lifecycle, then proves the ready-mode chip, a foreign-mode
picker option named `not available for this model`, distinct WAV bytes with and
without the adapter, and that deleting the used voice leaves a playable take
named `voice deleted` after reload. It does not seed a ready status or adapter
storage path. Tear the isolated stack down afterwards with the same environment
and `docker compose ... down -v`.

## Testing Patterns

### Python

- **Real SQLite** for DB tests (`tmp_path` per test, `seeded_db` fixture in `conftest.py`)
- **Synthesized audio** for mastering/scoring tests (sine waves via numpy)
- **Mock external services**: scheduler dispatch, Whisper model, Claude API, ffmpeg
- **Patch at the import location**, not the source: `patch("songmaker_cli.jobs.dispatch_generation")`
- **Factory fixtures** in conftest.py for WAV bytes, stereo audio, song files
- **`Settings` constructed with explicit kwargs** in tests; no monkeypatching of `os.environ` for the fields. Use `monkeypatch.setenv` only for the import-time env vars set in `conftest.py` (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `SONGMAKER_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `WORKER_ID`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`)

### Frontend

- **jsdom** environment for all tests
- **Mock fetch** globally for API client tests
- **Mock stores** for component isolation
- **`vi.useFakeTimers()`** for job polling tests
- **Svelte store tests** use `get()` to read reactive values
- **jsdom ships no `Worker`**, so `alignInWorker` runs the same pure alignment synchronously there.
  A test that needs to see the state *before* the answer arrives (`NowPlayingLyrics.test.ts`) stubs
  `Worker` with a fake that runs the real pure function and delivers it when the test says so. Every
  such fake `postMessage` **structured-clones its request**, so a take that could not really cross
  the worker boundary — reactive `$state` cues from a share page — fails in the test too
- **Runes need a `.svelte.ts` module**: `src/tests/reactive-fixtures.svelte.ts` hands a plain
  `.test.ts` a real `$state` proxy or props a mounted component follows when the test changes them
- **The service worker's worker precache is a build artifact**: Vite bundles Web Workers in a pass
  whose output never reaches the client manifest `$service-worker`'s `build` list comes from, so
  `pnpm build` runs `scripts/inject-worker-precache.mjs` to rewrite the hashed chunk paths into the
  built file. Unit tests cover the injection; the artifact itself is proven by `pnpm build` and
  `grep workers/ frontend/build/service-worker.js`
- **Hitbox floor tests measure the real cascade, not the hitbox sheet alone.** Vitest never extracts
  a mounted component's scoped `<style>` into the document, so a test that only injects the global
  hitbox sheet (`test-utils/hitbox.ts`) cannot see a component's own rule outrank it — that is exactly
  how the Breadcrumb link shrank to 0px and stayed unclickable (#185) while its hitbox test stayed
  green. `test-utils/component-styles.ts` recompiles a component's own source and injects its `<style>`
  pinned to the scope class already on the mounted DOM, so `frequent-hitbox.test.ts`'s inventory
  measures every target against hitbox sheet + component sheet together. It asserts the floor twice:
  once with `setPointer()` unset, at the exact specificity `[data-hitbox='frequent']` and its
  `@media (any-pointer: coarse)` variant ship at in production (jsdom cannot match `any-pointer`
  itself, hence `setPointer()`'s `html[data-pointer]` selectors exist at all — but that override is
  more specific than a two-class scoped selector, so it would mask the exact regression this exists
  to catch), and again through `setPointer('fine'|'coarse')` for the pixel values themselves.

## Adding Tests for New Features

1. Add unit tests for new functions/modules
2. Add API tests if new endpoints are added (use `TestClient` fixture in test_api.py)
3. Run `pytest --cov` to verify no gaps in new code
4. Frontend: add store tests for new state, component tests for new UI logic
