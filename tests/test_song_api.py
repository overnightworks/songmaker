"""Song list/detail API tests — query-cost regressions (#340, #331 Finding 1).

The song list previously touched each song's (unloaded) generations
relationship just to count it, costing one lazy-load query per row.
generation_count is now computed server-side in one aggregate query.

GET /api/songs/{id} previously joinedload()ed three sibling/nested
collections (versions, generations, generations.scores) in one query,
producing a SQL cross join -- one row per (version, generation, score)
combination. This file also pins its query count after the selectinload()
fix (#331 Finding 1).
