"""Tests for the /health endpoint: Claude CLI tool-surface reporting and
ACE-Step worker health computation.

Issue #367: a worker whose GPU has gone away (NVML present but unreachable —
a driver mismatch, a vanished device) keeps heartbeating to Redis just fine,
so the pre-fix "online" check (heartbeat key exists) kept counting it as a
healthy worker forever. These tests simulate that exact failure via the
``gpu_healthy`` flag the worker now publishes in its heartbeat state,
never a lucky real GPU.
